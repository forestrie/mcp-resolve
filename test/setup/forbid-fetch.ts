 * src/core never fetches and src/net is tested only through
 * injected fakes. Any real fetch under any unit test is a bug, not a slow
 * test — so the whole unit project runs with a fetch that throws, rather
 * than a per-call swap.
 *
 * The message names the invariant, not the symptom: a stack trace ending
 * here is telling you that src/core reached the network, or that a
 * src/net test used the real `globalThis.fetch` default instead of
 * injecting a fake through `fetchImpl`.
 *
 * Scope note: fetch only, deliberately. Blocking node:net's
 * Socket.prototype.connect would be the strong version, but it fires on
 * vitest's own worker IPC. The esbuild gate already proves src/core has no
 * path to node:net at all, which is the stronger statement for the layer
 * that matters.
